Chikitsak has been made to scale up the existing telemedicine and Patient MIS in rural areas using Serverless Architecture to provide a cost-economic one stop solution which is dependable and truly secure. The objective is to give the citizens a **Live Doctor Interface** which has a **serverless architecture** and can be remotely accessed irrespective of geographic location.

## Features üí¨
1. Once user installs Chikitsak on his phone, he can schedule a test, communicate with a doctor, request appointment and view all his previous data in a cost effective way.

2. Chikitsak has a serverless architecture:

     * Our prime focus is on user's **cost** and **privacy**. The passwords are securely stored without the intervention of any third-party applications and this **prevents dataleaks** from occuring.
     * It is highly **reliable**.
     * Requires **very low maintenance**.
     * It is **highly scalable** - if many people want to use the same account to store different family user's data.

3. Doesn't require any subscription:

    * It is available **free** of cost for students/people having Azure Student account.
    * For rest of the users, there is **minimal payment** for Azure account which is equivalent to a meal from one of your favourite burger joints.
